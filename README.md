# UltimateFlox
2D flocking simulation using GLFW and Glad

Use the ```1``` key to switch to line rendering mode.<br>
Use the ```2``` key to switch to filled rendering mode.<br>
Use the ```Space``` key to pause the simulation.<br>

Create a ```flox.txt``` file in the executable's directory to control the flock size.
A single unambiguous integer should be placed in the file. The simulation will default to 8 boids otherwise.
