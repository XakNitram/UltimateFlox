# UltimateFlox
2D flocking simulation using GLFW, Glad, and GLM - your very own bird box.

Use the ```1``` key to switch to filled rendering mode.<br>
Use the ```2``` key to switch to classic rendering mode.<br>
Use the ```b``` key to toggle display of the boids.<br>
Use the ```v``` key to toggle display of the vision radii.<br>
Use the ```q``` key to toggle display of the quadtree.<br>
Use the ```s``` key to toggle speed debug vision mode.<br>
Use the ```Space``` key to pause the simulation.<br>

Create a ```flox.txt``` file in the executable's directory to control the flock size.
A single unambiguous integer should be placed in the file. The simulation will default to 512 boids otherwise.
